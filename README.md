# Option Theory - Stochastic Systems

The aim of this paper is to deduce the pricing of a stock option through the use of the Black-Scholes model.

Options are useful because they reduce the risk of share speculation. This is due to the fact that options can be used to capitalise on an increase in share price with a small prior investment. In the paper we will elaborate further on the definition of an option.

Black-Scholes is a mathematical model used to determine the price of an option. The model is attributed to the work done by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, and was developed further by Robert C Merton. This pricing model is largely used by traders who buy or sell options that are lower or higher (respectively) than the Black-Scholes calculated value.
